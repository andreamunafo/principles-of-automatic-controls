    "# A Guide to Updating Your Local Repository with Git in Anaconda's Virtual Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide is designed for students working with the [Principles of Automatic Controls](https://github.com/andreamunafo/principles-of-automatic-controls) GitHub repository. It will walk you through updating your local copy of the repository to include the latest changes without losing your work, specifically focusing on experiments within the `tclab` subdirectory. We'll be using Git within Anaconda's `control_env` virtual environment, ensuring a consistent working environment for all.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Git?\n",
    "\n",
    "Git is a version control system that lets you track changes, revert to previous states, and collaborate on projects like your Jupyter notebooks. Using Git, you can update your work with changes made by others without losing your local modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Anaconda:** Ensure you have Anaconda installed. We'll use Anaconda to manage our Python environment.\n",
    "2. **Git:** Make sure Git is installed on your system. Anaconda's Command Prompt can also handle Git commands if Git is not separately installed.\n",
    "3. **Basic Terminal Use:** Familiarize yourself with opening and using the terminal or Anaconda Prompt. You'll enter commands here.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 0: Setting Up\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Open Anaconda Prompt:** Search for Anaconda Prompt in your Start Menu (Windows) or applications folder (macOS/Linux) and open it.\n",
    "2. **Activate Your Virtual Environment:** Type the following command to activate the `control_env` environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda activate control_env\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This step ensures all commands run in an isolated environment with specific package versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Navigate to Your Repository\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the `cd` command to change directories to where your local repository is stored. Replace `path/to/repository` with the actual path to your folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd path/to/repository\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're unsure about the path, use the `dir` command (Windows) or `ls` (macOS/Linux) to list directories and navigate step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Commit Your Local Changes\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Stage Changes:** Add all modified files to the staging area, preparing them to be committed. This includes any experiments in the `tclab` directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git add .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Commit Changes:** Save your staged changes to the local repository's history with a descriptive message.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git commit -m \"Save my local changes\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 3: Fetch and Merge Updates\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fetch Updates:** Download changes from the remote repository without merging them. This allows you to see what's new.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git fetch origin\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Merge Updates:** Combine the fetched changes with your local work. If there's no conflict, Git will do this automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git merge origin/master\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Replace `master` with `main` or the appropriate branch name if it's different.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 4: Resolve Merge Conflicts (If Any)\n",
    "\n",
    "Conflicts occur when the same part of a file has been edited differently in your local version and the new updates. Git will tell you which files are conflicted.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Edit Conflicted Files:** Open each conflicted file in a text editor. Look for sections marked with `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>`, and decide how to integrate the changes.\n",
    "2. **Mark as Resolved:** After fixing the conflicts, add the files back to the staging area and commit them.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git add .\n",
    "git commit -m \"Resolved conflicts\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 5: Keep Your Changes Local\n",
    "\n",
    "As per course rules, do not push your changes back to the main repository. This ensures that your experiments remain personal and do not affect others' work.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Additional Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Regular Updates:** Frequently updating your local repository can minimize conflicts.\n",
    "- **Ask for Help:** If you're stuck, don't hesitate to ask for assistance. Learning to navigate Git and the terminal is a valuable skill.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following these steps, you'll be able to maintain an up-to-date local copy of the course material while preserving your personal experiments and modifications."
