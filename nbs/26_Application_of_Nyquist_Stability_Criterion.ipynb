    "\n",
    "### Indentation Method for Nyquist Contour\n",
    "- **Technique of Contour Indentation**: To navigate around this challenge, the Nyquist contour is modified by indenting around the pole in question. This is done by sketching a small semicircle with radius $ \\epsilon $ adjacent to the pole, with $ \\epsilon $ approaching zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rationale Behind Indentation**: This adjustment is a practical measure. It's important to note that having a pole exactly at the origin or on the imaginary axis often represents an idealized situation. In real-world systems, such poles would typically be located very close to, but not exactly on, the left-hand side of the complex plane (LHP).\n",

    "- **Implication for Stability Analysis**: This indentation method is a mathematical strategy to simplify the Nyquist plot while retaining accurate stability analysis. The essential aspect of the analysis remains unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nyquist Contour Modification and Stability Analysis\n",
    "- **Direction of Detouri|ng**: The direction in which the contour is detoured around the pole does not pose a problem. However, it's crucial to note the implications of this detouring on the stability criterion.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inclusion of Poles in Nyquist Contour**: If the detouring includes an open-loop pole within the Nyquist contour, this must be accounted for in the stability analysis. The enclosed pole contributes to the count of $ P $ in the Nyquist stability criterion, formulated as $ N = P - Z $.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Consistent Results in Stability**: Regardless of the detouring direction, the resulting assessment of closed-loop stability remains consistent. What changes is the specific value of $ N $ obtained in the Nyquist criterion, while the overall stability conclusion for the system stays the same.\n",
