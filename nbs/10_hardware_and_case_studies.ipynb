    "#### Components and their Roles:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Actuator (Motor and Power Amplifier)**:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - The actuator provides the necessary torque to drive the load at the desired speed, $\\omega$.\n",
    "    - It comprises a motor combined with a power amplifier.\n",
    "    - The actuator receives a control signal, $u$, from a controller.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. **Controller (Amplifier)**:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - In this basic setup, the controller is a simple amplifier. However, in more advanced configurations, it could be a complex system involving the derivative or integral of an error signal.\n",
    "    - The controller's primary role is to process the error signal and produce an appropriate control signal, $u$.\n",
    "    - We will see how to design controllers later\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Reference Input Elements (Potentiometer)**:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - This component provides the reference signal, $e_r$, which corresponds to the required commanded speed, $\\omega_r$ (not shown in the diagram). We would like $\\omega \\rightarrow \\omega_r$\n",
    "    - By adjusting the position of the potentiometer's wiper arm, one can change the reference signal, thereby commanding a different speed.\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. **Feedback Element (Tachogenerator)**:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - The tachogenerator senses the actual speed, $\\omega_r$, and produces a feedback signal, $e_t$, that's proportional to this speed.\n",
    "    - This feedback signal is essential to compare the actual speed with the desired speed and generate an error signal.\n",
    "    - The difference between $e_r$ (proportional to controlled variable) and $e_t$ (proportional to commanded variable) provides the actuating error signal $\\hat{e}$.\n",
    "    - The actuating error signal $\\hat{e}$ is amplified through the controller to generate the control signal $u$ and provided to the actuator that runs the load.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that the primary goal of controller design is to adjust it appropriately to meet specific objectives. While other components, like the motor, remain constant and may not be easily modified, it's more practical and efficient to alter the controller settings."

    "### Motor's Components\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Armature**: The armature is the primary rotating component of the motor. It carries the current (often referred to as the armature current, $i_a$, which interacts with the magnetic field produced by the field windings.\n",
    "This interaction between the current and the magnetic field results in a torque that causes the armature to rotate.\n",
    "The voltage across the armature ($e_a$) and the current through it ($i_a$) determine the speed and torque of the motor.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Field Windings**: These are coils wrapped around the motor's stator, which produce a magnetic field when energized. When current passes through the field windings, it produces a magnetic field.\n",
    "In an armature-controlled motor, the field current ($i_f$) is typically held constant, ensuring a consistent magnetic field.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The strength of the magnetic field generated by the field windings affects the motor's torque and speed.\n",
    "- By varying the field current, one can control the motor's characteristics, especially in field-controlled motors.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Back EMF ($e_b$), (Electromotive Force)**: As the armature rotates, it induces a voltage that opposes the applied armature voltage. This induced voltage is called the back EMF ($e_b$).\n",
    "\n",
    "- It acts as a natural feedback mechanism: as the motor speed increases, the back EMF increases, which in turn reduces the net voltage across the armature and thus limits the speed.\n",
    "- It's directly proportional to the motor's speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The back EMF plays a crucial role in stabilizing the motor's speed. Understanding its dynamics is essential for designing controllers that can efficiently regulate motor speed, especially in armature-controlled motors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The motor in our control system is characterized by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- applied armature voltage, $e_a$\n",
    "- its armature resistance, $R_a$\n",
    "- and current $i_a$.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it runs, it produces a torque $T_M$. This torque, along with a disturbance torque $T_W$, acts on the motor shaft.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Commutator**\n",
    "A commutator is essential in a direct current (DC) motor because it serves the function of switching the direction of current through the motor's windings as the armature rotates. This switching is necessary to maintain a continuous rotational motion. \n",
    "\n",
    "   1. **Rotation Principle**: In a DC motor, the armature (the rotating part) is placed within a magnetic field created by the stator (the stationary part). When electric current flows through the armature windings, it generates a force (as described by Lorentz's law) that acts perpendicular to both the magnetic field and the current, causing the armature to rotate.\n",
    "\n",
    "   2. **Continuous Rotation**: For continuous rotation, the direction of the current in the armature windings must be reversed every half turn (180 degrees). Without this reversal, the armature would stop moving when it aligns with the magnetic field because the forces on both sides of the armature would balance out.\n",
    "\n",
    "   3. **Function of the Commutator**: The commutator, attached to the armature's shaft, rotates with the armature. It consists of segments connected to different parts of the armature windings. Brushes, stationary conductive contacts, supply current to the commutator. As the commutator rotates, the connections between the windings and the external electrical circuit are reversed at the precise moment necessary to maintain the rotation direction of the motor. This ensures that the torque direction remains constant, allowing for continuous rotation."

In simple terms, it provides a measure of how effective the motor is in converting electrical current into mechanical torque. A higher $K_T$ implies that the motor can generate more torque for the same current. Its unit is Newton meter per ampere (Nm/A).\n",

When a motor rotates, it inherently generates an EMF opposing the driving voltage; this is called the back EMF. $K_b$ quantifies this effect, essentially indicating how much voltage the motor generates for every radian/second it rotates. Its unit is volts per radian per second (V/(rad/s)).\n",

    "- This equivalence is not just a mathematical curiosity; it has real-world implications. For example, when designing motor controllers or when procuring motors for specific applications, knowing that $K_T$ and $K_b$  are equal (under consistent units) can simplify calculations and provide insights into motor behavior.\n",
    "- From an experimental standpoint, measuring $K_b$ is simpler and potentially more accurate than measuring $K_T$.

    "# Making a Motor Selection: Factors to Consider\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's delve deeper into how the choice between different types of motors, specifically field controlled versus armature controlled motors, is made based on specific applications. Remember, every engineering decision involves trade-offs. In our context, these decisions revolve around power, performance, cost, and specific application requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Field vs. Armature Circuit**:\n",
    "- Power Amplifier Requirements: One significant advantage of the **field circuit** is the lower power amplifier requirements. The total power needed to drive the field circuit is considerably less than what's required for the armature circuit. This means a less costly power amplifier would suffice.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cost Implications: A direct consequence of the reduced power amplifier requirements is the cost. The power amplifier for a field circuit is generally more economical compared to that for the armature circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Challenges with Armature Current**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Maintaining a consistent armature current, especially when it's high, poses a challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **How to Keep Armature Current Constant?**\n",
    "  - The armature current can be kept fairly consistent by using a high constant voltage source.\n",
    "  - If the resistance of the circuit $R$ is considerably larger than the armature circuit's resistance and the voltage source is robust, then the armature current $i_a$ will remain relatively constant.\n",

    "- **What Causes Changes in $i_a$** ?\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Overcoming the Challenge**:\n",
    "  - Using a substantial voltage source and significant resistance can help keep the armature current roughly constant. However, this approximation is more accurate when the required armature current isn't too high. For this reason, \n",

    "3. **Field-Controlled vs. Armature-Controlled Motors for Different Power Needs**:\n",
    "- **Low Power Servos**: Field-controlled motors are a compelling choice for low power servos. When there's a low power requirement, such that the armature current $i_a$ remains low, it's feasible to maintain that current at a reasonably constant value.\n",
    "- **High Power Servos**: For high power servos, armature-controlled motors are typically preferred. In many industrial control applications, armature-controlled motors are chosen over field-controlled motors. These motors not only provide more power but also offer advantages like intrinsic damping, allowing for better control.\n",

    "\n",
    "Advancements have addressed some of the challenges associated with these motor drives. Some key trends include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Brushless DC Motors**: One major challenge with the motors discussed so far is the brush friction, which introduces non-linearity into our mathematical models. \n",
    "\n",
    "Brushless DC motors, with electronic commutation, are now available to mitigate the non-linear effects due to brush friction. Note that in our modeling we have assumed that we can have a linear model, with viscous friction only and neglecting the effects of brush fiction (which is constant frictional source independent on the speed - this would make the model non-linear).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Gears and Backlash**: Our discussion assumes a linear relationship between motor input and output through gears and the defined gear ratio. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, in reality, gear backlash introduces non-linearity. This is due to the fact that when the gears have to reverse this will not be instantaneous (e.g., object tracking requires the tracker to move back and forth and hence the motor will need to often reverse its direction). **Direct-drive** motors are now designed to interface directly with the load, eliminating the need for gear trains and the associated nonlinear challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Feedback Mechanisms**: Although potentiometers provide a simple way to measure angular position, they introduce their own challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example they have a finite resolution. \n",
    "The resolution (minimum change in output voltage obtained by moving the wiper, expressed as a percentage of the total applied voltage) of precision wire-wound potentiometers ranges from 0.001 to 0.5 percent. This discontinuous output voltage contributes to servo inaccuracy. Potentiometers are _temperature-sensitive_, a characteristic that affects their accuracy. The wiper contact is another limiting factor, being subject to wear and dirt and potentially producing electrical noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our models we have neglected these nuances and assumed a linear relationship between $\\theta_R$ and $e_r$ through $\\theta_R = K_p e_r$. Modern systems are leaning towards more advanced sensors that offer higher precision and better linearity."
